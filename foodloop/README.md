Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn to create a simple full-stack web application using AWS Amplify. Throughout this tutorial, you will build and host a React application on AWS, use Amplify to add authentication, data, and a serverless function to capture the signed-up user's email and save it in the database. Then, you will implement a frontend for your app that integrates with your cloud resources.
